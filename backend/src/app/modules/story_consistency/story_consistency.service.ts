First, logically segment the story into chronological events.
For each event segment:
1. State the brief event description.
2. Identify new facts established (e.g. "Jack is carrying a golden key", "Jack is in the castle hall").
3. Identify facts that were previously true but are now superseded/invalidated (e.g. "Jack drops the key" supersedes "Jack is carrying a golden key").

Second, check for any logical/temporal contradictions where the narrative violates active facts established in previous steps.
